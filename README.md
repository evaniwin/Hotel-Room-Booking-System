4.  Design and implement the Hotel Room Booking System using Object-Oriented
    Programming (OOP) principles in Java and limited use of SQL.
    The system should manage hotel operations such as room reservations, guest details, billing,
    and room availability tracking.
        I. Class Design
            ● Room: Attributes like room number, room type (e.g., single/double/deluxe), price per
              night, and availability status.
            ● Guest: Attributes like guest name, ID, contact information, and booking history.
            ● Booking: Attributes like booking ID, guest, room, check-in date, check-out date.
            ● HotelManager: Manages room inventory and booking operations (e.g.,
              adding/removing rooms, managing reservations).

        II. Functionalities
            a. Room Management:
                ● Add, remove, and update room details.
                ● View room availability by type.

            b. Booking Operations:
                ● Book a room: Check room availability and register the booking.
                ● Cancel a booking: Update room status and remove the booking record.
                ● Calculate total bill based on room price and duration of stay.

        III. Deliverables
            ● Design Document: Description of class structure, attributes, methods, and
              interactions.
            ● Source Code: Java code with comments implementing the functionalities.
            ● User Manual: Setup instructions and step-by-step usage guide.
            ● Test Cases: Input/output examples to verify system features.
